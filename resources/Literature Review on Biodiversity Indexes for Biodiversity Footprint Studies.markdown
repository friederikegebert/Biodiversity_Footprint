# Literature Review: Biodiversity Indexes Used for Biodiversity Footprint Studies

Biodiversity footprint studies are critical for understanding and mitigating the impacts of human activities on global ecosystems. These studies quantify how consumption, production, and resource use affect biodiversity, often focusing on drivers like land use, greenhouse gas emissions, and overexploitation. To measure these impacts, specific biodiversity indexes are employed, ranging from traditional ecological metrics to specialized indicators tailored for footprint assessments. This literature review synthesizes the current state of knowledge on biodiversity indexes used in biodiversity footprint studies, drawing from peer-reviewed articles, reports, and frameworks.

## 1. Introduction
Biodiversity, encompassing the variety of life from genes to ecosystems, is declining rapidly due to human activities. The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and frameworks like the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) emphasize the need to measure and reduce biodiversity loss. Biodiversity footprint studies assess the impact of human consumption and production on biodiversity, often using life cycle assessment (LCA) methodologies to trace impacts across global supply chains. These studies rely on biodiversity indexes to quantify impacts, enabling comparisons across regions, industries, and time periods. This review explores both traditional ecological biodiversity indexes and specialized metrics used in footprint studies, highlighting their applications, tools, and challenges.

## 2. Traditional Biodiversity Indexes in Ecological Research
Traditional biodiversity indexes are foundational in ecology, measuring species diversity within specific areas. While these indexes are less directly applied in biodiversity footprint studies, they provide context for understanding biodiversity and are sometimes referenced in broader assessments. The following indexes are commonly used, as detailed in the study "Choosing and using diversity indices: insights for ecological applications from the German Biodiversity Exploratories" (Morris et al., 2014, [PMC4224527](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4224527/)):

| **Index**                  | **Formula**                          | **Description**                                                                 |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Species Richness (S)       | Number of species                   | Counts the total number of species in a community.                              |
| Shannon’s Diversity (H’)   | −∑ P_i ln(P_i)                      | Measures diversity by considering species richness and abundance, where P_i is the proportion of species i. |
| Simpson’s Diversity (D1)   | 1 − ∑ P_i^2                         | Calculates the probability that two randomly selected individuals belong to different species. |
| Simpson’s Dominance (D2)   | 1/∑ P_i^2                           | Measures the dominance of the most abundant species.                            |
| Simpson’s Evenness (E)     | D2/S                                | Assesses how evenly individuals are distributed among species.                  |
| Berger–Parker Dominance (BP)| P_max                               | Represents the proportion of the most abundant species (P_max).                 |

These indexes are effective for local-scale ecological monitoring but are less suited for biodiversity footprint studies, which require metrics that capture global, consumption-driven impacts. Their use in footprint studies is typically limited to baseline ecological assessments or complementary analyses.

## 3. Biodiversity Indexes in Footprint Studies
Biodiversity footprint studies focus on quantifying the indirect and cumulative impacts of human activities on biodiversity, often using LCA or input-output analysis. These studies employ specialized indexes that measure ecosystem degradation or species loss due to pressures like land use, climate change, and pollution. The most prominent indexes include:

### 3.1 Mean Species Abundance (MSA)
- **Description**: MSA quantifies the average abundance of original species in an ecosystem relative to an undisturbed state, expressed as a percentage (0% for fully degraded ecosystems to 100% for pristine ecosystems). It is often reported in units like MSA.km² to account for spatial impacts.
- **Application**: MSA is a core metric in the Global Biodiversity Score (GBS), a tool developed by CDC Biodiversité to assess corporate and investment biodiversity footprints ([TNFD GBS](https://tnfd.global/tools-platforms/global-biodiversity-score/)). GBS uses MSA to evaluate impacts across value chains, aligning with frameworks like the Taskforce for Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD).
- **Relevance**: MSA is valued for its ability to measure ecosystem intactness, making it suitable for assessing the cumulative effects of human activities. It is particularly useful in regulatory contexts, such as the EU Taxonomy, which mandates biodiversity disclosures.

### 3.2 Potentially Disappeared Fraction of Species (PDF)
- **Description**: PDF estimates the potential loss of species richness due to human activities, relative to undisturbed ecosystems. It is typically expressed in units like PDF.km².year, reflecting the spatial and temporal extent of impact.
- **Application**: PDF is used in tools like the ISS ESG Biodiversity Impact Assessment Tool (BIAT) and the Corporate Biodiversity Footprint (CBF). For example, BIAT employs PDF to measure the biodiversity impact of global equities, identifying sectors like Consumer Staples and Materials as major contributors to biodiversity loss ([ISS Governance](https://insights.issgovernance.com/posts/measuring-the-biodiversity-impact-of-global-equities/)).
- **Relevance**: PDF is effective for LCA-based assessments, allowing comparisons of biodiversity impacts across products, industries, or regions. It is particularly useful for highlighting the concentration of impacts, as BIAT notes that the top 100 companies contribute about 60% of total PDF globally.

### 3.3 Ecological Footprint (EF)
- **Description**: The Ecological Footprint measures human demand on nature against the planet’s biocapacity, expressed as a ratio. Values above 1 indicate unsustainable resource use, which indirectly affects biodiversity.
- **Application**: EF is adopted by the CBD as a biodiversity indicator and is referenced in the 2022 Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (Target 16) ([Global Footprint Network](https://www.footprintnetwork.org/biodiversity/)). It is used to assess macro-level trends in biodiversity loss driven by consumption.
- **Relevance**: While not a direct biodiversity index, EF provides a broader context for understanding biodiversity impacts, complementing MSA and PDF in footprint studies.

### 3.4 Other Indexes
- **Red List Index (RLI)**: Tracks extinction risk trends based on IUCN Red List data, used in CBD assessments to monitor species-level impacts ([Science Advances](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abj8093)).
- **Species Threat Abatement and Restoration (STAR)**: Quantifies contributions to reducing species loss, used in tools like the CBF ([ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0959652624015270)).

These indexes are tailored to capture the global, consumption-driven nature of biodiversity loss, making them more suitable for footprint studies than traditional ecological indexes.

## 4. Tools and Frameworks
Several tools and frameworks operationalize these biodiversity indexes, enabling businesses, financial institutions, and policymakers to assess and mitigate biodiversity impacts:

| **Tool/Framework**                     | **Primary Index** | **Description**                                                                 | **Source**                                                                 |
|----------------------------------------|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Global Biodiversity Score (GBS)        | MSA               | Assesses corporate and investment footprints using MSA.km², breaking down impacts across value chains. | [TNFD GBS](https://tnfd.global/tools-platforms/global-biodiversity-score/) |
| Corporate Biodiversity Footprint (CBF) | PDF               | Calculates direct biodiversity impacts from products or processes, supporting double materiality assessments. | [TNFD CBF](https://tnfd.global/tools-platforms/corporate-biodiversity-footprint/) |
| ISS ESG Biodiversity Impact Assessment Tool (BIAT) | PDF, MSA          | Measures biodiversity impacts of global equities, focusing on land-use change as a key driver. | [ISS Governance](https://insights.issgovernance.com/posts/measuring-the-biodiversity-impact-of-global-equities/) |
| Biodiversity Footprint for Financials (BFFI) | MSA               | Screens biodiversity impacts across financial portfolios, often using MSA-based metrics. | [Biodiversity Metrics](https://www.biodiversity-metrics.org/bffi.html)     |
| Ecological Footprint (EF)              | EF                | Compares human demand to biocapacity, used in CBD and IPBES frameworks.          | [Global Footprint Network](https://www.footprintnetwork.org/biodiversity/) |

These tools are increasingly critical for meeting regulatory requirements, such as the EU Taxonomy and GBF Target 15, which mandate biodiversity footprint disclosures. They also support voluntary frameworks like the TNFD and Science Based Targets Network (SBTN).

## 5. Methodological Approaches
Biodiversity footprint studies often employ LCA and multi-regional input-output (MRIO) analysis to link consumption patterns to biodiversity impacts:
- **Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)**: LCA is the dominant methodology, assessing environmental impacts across all life cycle stages (raw material extraction, manufacturing, distribution, use, and disposal). Tools like GBS and BIAT use LCA to calculate MSA and PDF ([ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195925523001002)).
- **Multi-Regional Input-Output Analysis (MRIO)**: MRIO traces biodiversity impacts through global trade, used in studies like "Quantifying Biodiversity Losses Due to Human Consumption" (Lenzen et al., 2017, [ACS](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.6b05296)).

These approaches ensure that both direct and indirect impacts are captured, addressing the globalized nature of modern supply chains.

## 6. Challenges and Gaps
Despite advancements, several challenges persist in biodiversity footprint assessment:
- **Lack of Comprehensive Metrics**: A critical review of 64 biodiversity assessment methods found that no single index captures all biodiversity dimensions, including pressures, ecosystems, and taxonomic groups (Damiani et al., 2023, [ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195925523001002)).
- **Alignment with Global Frameworks**: Tools like GBS and CBF are promising, but gaps remain in aligning metrics with the GBF. A study on "Glaring gaps in tools to estimate businesses’ biodiversity impacts" highlights the need for integrated indexes consistent with GBF goals (Lammerant et al., 2024, [ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0959652624015270)).
- **Data and Resource Constraints**: Footprinting requires extensive data on supply chains and biodiversity impacts, which can be costly and complex to collect. Communicating results to stakeholders also poses challenges.
- **Standardization Needs**: The diversity of tools and metrics complicates comparisons and regulatory compliance, necessitating standardized approaches.

## 7. Future Directions
Ongoing research aims to address these challenges by:
- Developing integrated biodiversity indexes that cover all dimensions of biodiversity loss.
- Enhancing data availability through global databases like EXIOBASE and Ecoinvent.
- Aligning tools with frameworks like the GBF and TNFD to support global conservation goals.
- Improving transparency and accessibility of footprinting methodologies to facilitate adoption by businesses and policymakers.

## 8. Conclusion
Biodiversity footprint studies play a vital role in quantifying the impacts of human activities on ecosystems, using specialized indexes like Mean Species Abundance (MSA), Potentially Disappeared Fraction of Species (PDF), and the Ecological Footprint (EF). These metrics, supported by tools like the Global Biodiversity Score (GBS) and ISS ESG Biodiversity Impact Assessment Tool (BIAT), enable businesses and financial institutions to assess and mitigate their biodiversity impacts. While traditional ecological indexes like Shannon’s diversity remain foundational, they are less directly applicable to footprint studies due to their local-scale focus. Challenges such as the lack of comprehensive metrics and data limitations persist, but advancements in LCA, MRIO, and global frameworks are driving progress toward standardized, effective biodiversity footprint assessments.
